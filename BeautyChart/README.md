Why making charts if they are not beautiful?
***Design and ideas partly copied from [AppPear/ChartView](https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView)***

## Installation

BeautyChart is available through SPM. To install
it, simply add this repository to dependencies

## Why?
I needed to include charts into my project, but existing solutions were ugly. I found [AppPear/ChartView](https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView) but didn't like its' architecture, little to no configuration capabilities. Therefore, I implemented what I needed by myself.
